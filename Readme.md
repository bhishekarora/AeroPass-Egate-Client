- **Peripheral Management**: Controls GPIO peripherals including LEDs, LCDs, servos, and various sensors.
- **Barcode Scanning**: Utilizes a USB camera to scan boarding pass barcodes.
- **AeroPass Server Integration**: Connects to an external AeroPass server to validate the passenger's PNR and facial data.
- **Biometric Verification**: Captures and matches the passenger's facial data against the serverâ€™s records.
- **Automated Gate Control**: Opens the gate by moving motors and turning the LED green when verification is successful.



## Software

- Egate controller interacts with above peripherals 
- Written in Python
- Fully customizable peripheral service , new sensors/motors can be added on SOC on demand.
- Fully extendible controller to support any kind of airport systems(DCS/SBDs)
